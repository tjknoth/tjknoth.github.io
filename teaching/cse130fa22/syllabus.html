<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
<h4 id="homework-assignments-45">Homework Assignments (45%)</h4>
<ul>
<li>There will be <em>six</em> programming assignments, assigned every one or two weeks.</li>
<li>Links to assignments will be posted on the <a href="assignments.html">assignments page</a>.</li>
<li>You will submit assignments via Gradescope.</li>
<li>You can work on the assignment <em>either alone or in groups of two</em>.</li>
<li>If you are working with a partner and submitting the same code, please <em>submit as a group</em> (otherwise identical code might be flagged as plagiarism).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Late Policy</strong></p>
<p>You have a total of <em>eight late days</em> that you can use throughout the quarter, but no more than <em>four late days</em> per assignment.</p>
<ul>
<li>A late day means anything between 1 second and 23 hours 59 minutes and 59 seconds past a deadline<br />
</li>
<li>If you submit past the late day limit, you get 0 points for that assignment</li>
<li>There is no penalty for submitting late but within the limit</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="midterm-25">Midterm (25%)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Will be held on <strong>Friday, October 28</strong></li>
<li>Format: multiple choice quiz on gradescope, available for 24 hours.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="final-30">Final (30%)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Will be held on <strong>Wednesday, December 7</strong>.</li>
<li>Format: programming assignment. Solved individually in the course of 24 hours, but otherwise similar to homeworks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the final is cumulative, your midterm grade will be calculated as <code>midterm &gt; 0 ?  max(final, midterm) : 0</code>. This means that you get a second chance if you don’t do well on the midterm but you must turn in both the midterm and the final.</p>
