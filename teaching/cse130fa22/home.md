## Overview

Programming Languages are the duct tape, bricks, mortar
and steel of the information age. Over the last thirty
years, a variety of languages with diverse features have
been developed, expressing radically different perspectives
of the idea of computation. CSE 130 is an introduction to
one of these perspectives: functional programming, as exemplified
by the lambda calculus and the Haskell language.
Functional programming lies at the heart of numerous languages,
language features, and design patterns.
Many students will be encountering this
paradigm and these languages for the first time. As with
spoken languages, these are best absorbed by immersing yourself
in the different environments and practicing your skills by
experimentation.
