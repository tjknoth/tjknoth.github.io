## Textbook
The primary textbook is _Discrete Mathematics and its Applications, Kenneth
Rosen, McGraw Hill, 7th edition_. We will mostly use it as a reference; I won't
assign readings. You can find additional self assessments and examples
[here](https://highered.mheducation.com/sites/0073383090/student_view0/index.html).
A potentially useful supplement is _Fundamentals of Discrete Math for Computer
Science: A Problem-Solving Primer, Jenkyns and Stephenson_.
If you're on campus, you can download the book
[here](http://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-1-4471-4069-6).

## Typesetting
You will need to typeset your homework assignments. You can use a word
processor, but it might be useful to use this as an opportunity to learn LaTeX
(and, once you get going, it will probably be the easiest way to typeset math as
well).
The easiest way to get started with LaTeX is probably with an [online editor](https://www.overleaf.com/).
If you'd like to install LaTeX locally, [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/)
is a full distribution.

Here is [one reference](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX), others can be easily
found online. The .tex source for the homework assignemts will be available as
examples as well.

## Writing
Mathematical writing can be strange.
[Here](https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~amenta/w10/writingman.pdf) is a decent guide
to all aspects of writing down your formal reasoning. Even if you don't write
proofs by hand in the future, this will help you clearly and logically express technical ideas.
