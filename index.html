I'm a senior compiler and algorithms engineer at
<a href="https://persimmons.ai/">persimmons.ai</a>,
where we're figuring out how to run large language models on chiplets.
<br />
<br />
My background is in programming languages:
I did my PhD on typed functional programming at UCSD with
<a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~npolikarpova/">Nadia Polikarpova</a>.
My dissertation explored rich type systems and their use in program
synthesis.
I've also worked on language design for next-gen EDA,
implemented high-performance numerical analysis with GPUs,
investigated
<a href="https://halide-lang.org/">Halide</a>
as a compiler IR for optimizing matrix operations,
and contributed to the
<a href="https://lbstanza.org/">L.B. Stanza language</a>.
<br />
<br />
Teaching was a highlight of grad school.
I was an instructor for courses on
<!-- <a href=/teaching/cse130fa22/home.html>CSE 130 (Fall 2022)</a> <br /> -->
<a href=/teaching/cse130fa22/index.html>programming languages</a>
and
<a href=/teaching/cse20ss221/home.html>discrete math</a>.
